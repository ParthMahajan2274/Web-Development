        <p1>
            Cricket is a popular sport played between two teams of eleven players each on an oval-shaped field. The game revolves around scoring runs by hitting the ball and running between two sets of stumps. Bowlers aim to dismiss batsmen while fielders assist by catching the ball and preventing runs. Cricket is played in various formats including Test matches (over five days), One Day Internationals (limited to 50 overs per side), and Twenty20 (20 overs per side). Major tournaments like the ICC Cricket World Cup and the Indian Premier League (IPL) attract global attention. Cricket's appeal lies in its strategic depth, skillful play, and cultural significance across countries like India, England, Australia, and beyond.

        <p>Cricket, originating in medieval England, has evolved into a globally cherished sport over centuries. Emerging as a popular pastime by the 18th century, cricket spread through the British Empire, finding avid followers in India, Australia, South Africa, and the Caribbean. The sport's pinnacle is Test cricket, established in 1877, known for its tradition and endurance.

The 20th century saw the advent of limited-overs formats, including One Day Internationals (ODIs) in the 1970s and the explosive growth of Twenty20 (T20) cricket in the 2000s, catering to modern audiences. Today, cricket thrives with global tournaments such as the ICC Cricket World Cup and domestic leagues like the Indian Premier League (IPL), uniting fans worldwide through its rich history and dynamic evolution.</p>
